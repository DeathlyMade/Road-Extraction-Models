# Road Extraction Using K-Means Clustering and Morphological Operations

The steps followed to obtained the road extracted image: 
 1) K-Means Clustering: The pixels are clustered according to their intensities. 

 2) Road Cluster Identification: Road clusters are identified from the cluters obtained. The cluster which has the longest component is choosen as the road cluster. 

 3) Road Cluster Filtering: Dilation and non-road area removal is performed. 

 4) Result Evaluation: The performance of the resultant image is evaluated by parameters like: completeness, correctness, and quality. 


### Pre-requisites

Before running the demo, make sure that the following python libraries are installed and working well. 

```
numpy
opencv-python
Matplotlib
wxPython
PIL
```

### Data

The sample images on which we ran our code, and the corresponding output images can be found here.

We collected these images from Google Maps and using drone. The reference images for result evaluation were created using Adobe Photoshop and thresholded using python.
